My #100DaysofMLCode?

## Day 0 : Jan 27 , 2020

**Initial thoughts** : Honestly I have no idea what im getting into and what this will turn out, I have always wanted to dig into machine learning and be good at this, but I always got distracted and never committed enough to really get things going on. Through some little pieces of efforts here and there, I have learned these myself online so far: CS50 - learned Python and C and other basic stuff; Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course, I actually completed the course and have a little notebook of the notes of everything I learned there (that frankly I am pretty proud of), FastAI: first 2 lessons and never really got further than that, I swear I have already done set up the Jupyter Notebook and Gcloud Instance environment a handful of times. Each time either something gets updated or it has been too damn long for me to remember how things work so I have to set things up all over again and again (which is what is happening right now). Now Im stuck again because I switched to a new computer and have never touched the things I should have been working on (FastAI & stuff) since September till now I guess.

**Expectations this time** : I guess the 100 days of ML challenge will be one attempt for me to get things going, I heard a great deal of gd things about this, I sincerely hope I can get this going and never look back. What I really want and hope to achieve: I want to be an expert/novice in machine learning, that I am good enough to at least know all the up-to-date techniques on different branch of ML and deep learning, I want to be good enough to be able to say one day, oh I should try work on this, decide on my own project, do it and get it to work whenever I want. There are already a list of things I have always dreamed of creating, e.g. a model that can play poker, one that can predict bet exchange price fluctuations, one that can have a decent rate of success of predicting stock market, one that predict the outcome of a race etc. Apart from responsibilities and my own schedule, I really hope this can become a habit that I feel compelled to do everyday, and I have by the end I will achieve at least something to my satisfaction. Also hopefully in this 100 days I will have done a project or 2 of my own.
 
**Today's Progress** : Not much I guess: reading the Github guide (I never actually knew how to use Github even tho I have had an account since like 2018), setting up this repo as a start (an alright start), tried to open up my old Gcloud instance Jupyter Notebook but failed, realised seems my new laptop (was gonna write has never been set up on the Gcloud thing), but then literally right at this moment as I was writing this page, I remember which terminal I had to use (Ubuntu), pasted the command to try and literally got it to work right now. I am already feeling much better about this lmao. That is a gd introduction day of some sort, but tmr is the real deal I guess, that only if I really start to work seriously tmr I can call that a great start.

**Thoughts** : I figured to really write down every bit of advice to myself that comes to my mind anytime that can motivate myself to work on this or improve the general efficiency of work progress here. Don't slack off this time u lazy fucker. 

Also found a page of 100DOMLC from a guy who proposed what u can study on each day, seems worth a peek everyday, link: https://github.com/Avik-Jain/100-Days-Of-ML-Code/blob/master/Code/Day%201_Data%20PreProcessing.md

**Advice of today** :
- literally no need to specify or think about how much effort Im gonna put in this time before starting to work, think oh 15 minutes or so would be fine first, and literally just do it
- "consistent efforts, however small, can help someone go a long way" - a random redditor

**Things to check out**: 
- the Deep Learning talk from Youtube, on the state of technology
- print notes of FastAI, get papers pictures whatever that may motivate u n stick it on the board to create a sort of work station
- email to ask for a chat with professor

**Expectation of tmr**: Do FastAI lesson 2 work (set up web app or something), maybe watch a bit of lesson 3 and of coz, update the 100DOMLC diary
- but first, clean your desk to even have a chance of making a proper work station
